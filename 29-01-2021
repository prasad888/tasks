Today I have done the topics

displayed the picture on the web site using the web server 

created a repo on github and pushed the photo to the git hub

done the SSH through the instance to github

cloned the repo from the github using the git clone

the photo copied to the location is (/var/www/html/)

writed the index.html file on the location is (/var/www/html)
	
	<center><h1>This is the photo</h1><img src="photo.jpeg" heigth="300" width="300" alt="photo" ></center>

using the html language deployed the imgage to the GUI


and knowing about the kubertes topics these are

Blue & Green strategy

Blue deplyment is the live one we have any update then using the green deplyment for the upgradtion
green deployment for the new upcoming live deployment 

slowly sending the data to blue monitering the logs with-out any errors after coming the total blue to green

green was changed to the blue color and blue was deleted or backuped

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Rolling update in kubernates

in the ec2 or pods create the new one
and slowly one-by-one move the old to new instance with-out any failure logs
and after sending the all data to new one then delete the old instance or pod 

It's the rollingupdate


Thanks & Regards
